# What's this?

Hi!
###
This is a simple, accesibility friendly todo-app made by closely following the guide at MDN Web Docs. I took on this project to learn concepts about the React and React Dom framework.
###
On top of following the guide, understading of the inner workings of react was put in place along side. This was so to allow me for a better understading of the inner workings of the framework.
Key concepts dissected and learned from this project:
- React basic component based structure
- React life cycle stages and virtual DOM
- Stateful Component based thinking for ui implementation
- Data decoupling from view components
- React function components and many basic hooks
- Special attributes ref and key
- Conditional ui rendering

Hopefully that list makes sense to you too. It was a fun project!
